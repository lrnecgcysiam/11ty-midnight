As opportunities created by the internet increase, so do inequities for those who do not have access to the technologies, tools and skills needed to participate in the increasingly digital world. This is where the digital divide is widen. Think of it as a gap between the "haves" and the "have nots" It is a generational curse that effects both rural and urban communities

Our mission statement to help everyone have access to the internet. The Internet is the best place to share your ideas and connect with virtually anyone with a connection to the web. The problem I have discovered people believe that building a website is hard and that it has to be complex inorder for it to be successful. This is incredibly far from the truth. The internet 
works just how the blockchain will work. The internet is a series of computers that are connected through a system called a network and this network uses a series of rules that tells the data, devices that wish to use the network how things are done.  

This organization will use various tools to help more people use the web the way it was orginally intended.
