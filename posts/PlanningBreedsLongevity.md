# Planning Breeds Longevity

        In early January of 2022 I attended a virtual event on Business Planning hosted by Patrick Bet-David and a guest speaker Tom Ellsworth. I paid a hefty entrance fee and I was really
        happy I did after the first hour of the event. One of the topics the event was about planning to start your business for the long term. Having a vision and staying true to your       principles and why you would want to even start a business in the first place. 


## The Education system is broken.


    Most people may understand that there is a problem with our education system. From Kindergarten all the way to graduate school and beyond. This is not intentional many people including myself has great expectations but the Internet has changed all of that alot. People can learn online for example there are many Olympic atheletes who didn't have an actual trainer but only using youtube videos. For entertainment many younger individuals learned how to play complex video games that requires fast hand eye coordination reading skills of variating degrees that might even conflict with many non-gamers. Then you take these same individuals and place them into our traditional eduation system and they are lost. They do minimum work and miss out on opportunities that normally effect a particular group of people it begins to warp there perception of themselves and there reality.


## How can we fix it?


  Improving this situation will take time and it won't be easy. Fixing this mess will take small acts of effort from all players. Whether your a technophile or a luddite. You can not just throw money at the problem but many of us have already experience the pain of the neglect and frustration of being in demotivated , rigged system and then buying back into it because the problem is "just to hard". 
I do propose a solution that I think is very formidable and quite promising. That is the ability to use GAMES. 

## Why are Games the key?


    Games are the key because they encouraging learning at the speed of the player. The player is giving a task or a problem and can try different options until they achieved the goal. For example games like Nintendo Pikmin for the Game Cube it is rated E for everyone. This game stars Captain Olimar a small bald, big-eared, bulbous-nosed spaceman who crashes into a unfamiliar planet when a comet hits his spaceship His  spaceship  lost parts and he must go on a journey to obtain them. The Player must carefully monitor there surroundings and the meter on there suit  that keeps track of the damage done to it by its poisonous atmosphere. He is also given help buy the planet's native life that he can summon at will through raising them from the ground it self. The Native life is called Pikmin and come in three colors reed,yellow and blue each having three skill. Captain Olimar must train them to perform certain tasks and protect him from danger. 

    This game is played through the gaming console controller and on a television screen to move around in this 3d world and solve several problems that would be educational. Managing resources, scanning for threats and learning over time with music and visual cues that informs the player they are on the right track or not. This allows the player to go into a trance like state. ( the state that most parents find to be a problem ) I am hoping to captivate that trance like state into learning  anything.

## How could my business help facilitate a solution for the cause.

    With my business plan I would like to assess all the ways that allows people explore there interest and obtain the skills to be a productive citizen within society. Using Games do not mean that everything has to be a gamified but hiding or allowing the learning to be made on their terms. I am professionally a Web aplication programmer who has built small to large scale application within the browser. I am mostly self taught and my motivation was how much I seen the Internet had to offer. It was not linear it started very slow and in order to continue learning I had to keep taking small risks in my professional career. I hold this to my experience with games and my belief that I would learn and reinvent myself when the time was right. Building web applications for small to mid range companies is not enough in my opinion you will probably need to engage your audience with some form of alternative learning exercises to increase loyalty and drive sales each and every month. Games do not have to be made from scratch either there are plenty of open source sandbox games that allows people to modify the original code to their liking and create totally new stories or quests. The key would be to help streamline this to a wider group and help teachers be able to teach or lecture with these powerful mediums.
