## I am finally going to start and finish writing my book this spring!

This year I am going to commit to writing at least 2 books on line in the form of 
blogs initially but later as a complete book physical and digital. The reason why I am posting this on my business plan because I envision my business can not stand with my customers, partners and employees knowing where I came from. It is difficult to explain anything to anyone if they do not know what your values or experiences are. I agree as well. I had to learn the hard way in getting help and attention to my cause with doing it in a way that did not get much traction.

## What will my book be about?

To view my early draft of theBook you can visit link above where you read the latest chapters. I am going to try and be as aggressive with this book I have already outlined how the book will go. But for the sake of the readers of my business plan blog I will share it again [here](https://thebook.lrnecgysiam.com/introdutions/).
