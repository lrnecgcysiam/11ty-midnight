## Distractions That consumed my mind in 2021

- Was I productive enough to say that 2021 was a productive year?
- Should I continue to work full time or work part time?
- Was my desire to run my own business still worth it?
- Should I go to Graduate School?
- Should I relocate to anoother area?
- Am I working on the wrong thing?

###  Was I productive enough to say that 2021 was a productive year?

When I started 2021 I have already been back in school since back in school since the Summer. Before that I as waiting for the world to " go back to normal" but when it didn't I came up with another idea. I had enough savings to defer going back to work and try to use the time and finish my 2nd Bachelor's degree. I tried to start  refreshing my social media accounts and  created a podcast about the things I was interested in to keep me focused. I would say at the end of the year I still felt
that I was not where I wanted to be. So I will say that 2021 was not as productive as I wanted it to be.

### Should I continue to work full time or work part time?

Working was my entire life growing up. Since I turned 16 years old and was able to obtain a work permit from my High School, I always held at least one job since then. The longest time I didn't have a job was perhaps a year when I lost my jobs and decided to finish school before looking for another one. (Fall 2004- Summer 2005). I was not able to get work in my field of expertise right away and needed to figure out whether it was time for me to obtain any job. I applied for a few jobs part
and was able to get a job at Costco for a seasonal position but I didn't stay very long I decided that it was not the way I wanted to work. The ideal work for me would be remote work where I continued to use my skills in Software development and finish my master's in computer science.

### Was my desire to run  my own business still worth it?

Of course I believe it is very much worth it. I think that many people are not using the internet the way it was intended. Mainly cause the families did not have time to think about the web technologies and there was very little effort to help people learn about them. So this will just force the next generation to have the similar fate which is worng in my opinion. One of the things the internet gives us is the ability to share our thoughts and ideas with whomever we choose and help others
learn about the world around them. The Internet auto transalation devices have gotten much better over the years so you can write in your own language and have an audience whose native tongue is not yoru own. My business is always rekindled with the burning desire to continue this mission to help people learn more about the web.

### Should I still go to Graduate School?

When I finished my first bachelors in 2005, I always wanted to go back to school. I didn't feel like I quite learned enough to pursue my dreams in Web development and  I don't believe that obtaining a Graduate degree will do any better. School has always been a beacon of hope for a better future for myself. Despite from many who have and have not finished College may think it is not necessary I still believe I have to disagree. My perspective about college was to be able to connect with
like-minded individuals who was willing to work together to increase our chances in being sucessful after College. College also gave me the opportunity to ask questions about topics in my field that would be difficult outside a University. You also get access to the university's libraries where thousands of  scholarly articles are available to find out about research in your interest.


### Should I relocate to another area?

I was never a fan of moving for the sake of moving just because I didn't like the area I was living in. I lived in New York practically my entire life and I don't have any interest in leaving any time soon. Although for the right opportunity I wouldn't mind moving either. I remember when I was interviewing for a job as a English Teacher for a Japanese Language Company the official stated to all the candidates that "Don't leave your country to come to Japan just so you can run away from
problems you are having right now. Those problems always tend to follow you whereever you go."


### Am I working on the wrong thing?

The "Wrong thing" is pertaining to the aspect of am I trying to solve the right problem with the wrong tools? Computers have always been very fascinating to me and I always wanted to learn more about them. How they work and how they communicate with each other. I know that we do not need to know much about computer technology to use them for example our smartphones do quite amazing stuff and I don't fully understand most of how it exactly works. Now I see that computers are dominating
almost every area of my life from entertainment to education to healthcare and government. You can not do much without knowing or at least having people who understand them enough before making any decisions for your life or business. So no this is the right to be focusing on.
