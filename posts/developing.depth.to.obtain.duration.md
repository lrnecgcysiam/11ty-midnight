## When you develop depth duration is a given.

When I was watching Patrick Bet-David talk about Duration vs Depth I realize I was playing the wrong game. That if I really
wanted to start a business that I was going to have to dig deeper and play harder. Things are always going to get tough. It is apart  of life and the life of an entrepreneur. In this post I would like to talk about where I see my business in 20 years.

### Why I took so long to write soemthing like this?

This has always been my assumption to keep private because it leaves my vulnerable to my enemies. The ones I believe are siting back in the shadows and trying to come up with a strategies to steal my idea  but this is an illusion. I now believe that it was just an excuse for me to never actually get started. Getting started was always a terrigfying experience and very hard to understand how to even complete such a thing.

### How I plan to stay in business.

Over the last 20 years I notice that technology has grown a lot and left many peole behind. So many people has not been able to tap into the power of the internet to improve there life including myself. I belieev that I have to come up with a strategy to teach others how to use the internet the way I believe it should be used. I believe that learning how to blog is a very good skill to have and it is not because the skill grants prosperity but it allows me to place my thoughts outside of
my head and give others a chance to read and interpret what I am trying to say. Using a blog to express my thoughts and ideas will allow me to not have my information open to just anyone who may see the information on their feed but hopefully people who are interested in success and would like to work with me.

### What will my employees get when they work for me?

Employees will be able to learn some of the techniques that are not shared among the normal system. They will learn how I think through the experience of working together. The internet for me has always been a tool to share information and allow people to share such information  quickly and safe. Social Media has not entirely done this. Platforms like facebook and twitter has forced us to create habits of "trolling" and dividing us as a society. Social media has been able to
increase its skills at keeping us glued to the screen for long periods of time. 

### The internet is like the industrial revolution.

In the 15th Century the printing press was invented and it allowed people to share information much faster then the original way which was word of mouth. People was able to obtain the ability to share their ideas through there work and thoughts and ideas moved much faster then it did before. The problem after the invention of the printing press was that people needed to learn to read. Being able to read was not as easy as it is today and you needed to find the time and resources
similar to learning how to program like you have to today.

### Why learning to code is so important. 

Being able to program gives you the ability to move information faster then you can with pen and paper and you will be able to become a sort of magician that with enough experience can do things that you coudl never do  before. The internet was designed to work by sharing files through a protocol called HTTP and TCP I will share a link later but these protocols act as a contract to how information moves across the network. Internet technologies are  ubiquitous across the web and the
Web browser is highly robust these days you don't need much in order to be productive online and because everyone has a smartphone these days you can share information fast as the speed of light. 

Writing a book online in your native language and then having it translated into another language is done as simple as a point and click in google translate or Apple Translate. You can download and edit videos with applications that run on your computer and save money avoiding using enterprise application like Adobe Creative cloud. The ability to be creative is become cheaper by the year and this is only the beginning. 

### How to remain relevant

If I wish to remain relevant as a business 20 years from now I must stay ahead of the changes in our technology and provide reasonable stragtegies for sharing content. One thing users should understand is it is not the number of follower that you have that is important but the number of actions each user places in your business. The internet has millions of bots that crawl the web and are not looking in your best interest in order to protect your content we must all begin to build
websites, applications and content that helps HUMAN BEINGS work together  many companies like facebook, instagram and twitter are working diligently to make the decision for you on what THEY think you want and you may not even be aware of it. In the next coming posts I will share how you can get the most ou to of your computer with simple programming tips
